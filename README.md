MInf1 - Manipulation Planning with a Robotic Arm - A Tangent Configuration Space Approach

The directories present in this source code folder are:
- C-IRIS_implementation
- drake_tutorials
- my_experiments
- tedrake_notebooks

my_experiments -> This contains the experiments, simulations, and visualisations run entirely by myself. They are in the form of Python notebooks. The last version of Drake (pydrake) is needed to execute them.
C-IRIS_implementation -> This directory contains the implementation provided by the authors of [1]. I adapted the code in this directory. A MOSEK license is required to run it.
drake_tutorials -> Online Drake notebook tutorials. They have been adapted too.
tedrake_notebooks -> Drake notebooks provided by Drake's founder, Russ Tedrake, for his course Robot Manipulation at MIT. The code snipped provided in the report comes from here. [2]
