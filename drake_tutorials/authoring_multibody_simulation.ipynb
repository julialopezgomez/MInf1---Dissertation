Each `<link>` has three major subtags, `<visual>`, `<collision>`, and `<inertial>`, for its visualization, planning/collision checking, and dynamics aspects. For `<visual>` and `<collision>`, you can either use primitives (box, sphere, cylinder, etc.) or meshes (.obj, .stl, and .dae) to represent the underlying geometry.\n","\n","Here are some useful resources specifically for [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch) and [SDFormat](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=build_model) creation.\n","\n","### URDF vs. SDFormat\n","\n","While URDF is the standardized format in ROS, it's lacking many features to describe a more complex scene. For example, URDF can only specify the kinematic and dynamic properties of a single robot in isolation. It can't specify joint loops and friction properties. Additionally, it can't specify things that are not robots, such as lights, heightmaps, etc.\n","\n","SDFormat was created to solve the shortcomings of URDF. SDFormat is a complete description for everything from the world level down to the robot level. This scalability makes it more suitable for sophisticated simulations.\n","\n","This tutorial will primarily focus on leveraging SDFormat, but the differences in using URDF should be minimal with some syntax changes.\n","\n","### Mesh file formats\n","\n","To use a mesh file for any of your robot `<link>` entries, OBJ (`.obj`) is currently the best-supported format in Drake. If you have other file formats instead, [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/), an open-source software, is a handy tool to convert common formats to a `.obj` for you."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"cell_id":"0ee46b29e39b4b4e82e683f4e2d456a2","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":202,"execution_start":1700242996092,"source_hash":null},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import some basic libraries and functions for this tutorial.\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","\n","from pydrake.common import temp_directory\n","from pydrake.geometry import StartMeshcat\n","from pydrake.math import RigidTransform, RollPitchYaw\n","from pydrake.multibody.parsing import Parser\n","from pydrake.multibody.plant import AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph\n","from pydrake.systems.analysis import Simulator\n","from pydrake.systems.framework import DiagramBuilder\n","from pydrake.visualization import AddDefaultVisualization, ModelVisualizer"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"cell_id":"00ba7a05ce094f078ab99b5dae6a53d1","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_millis":77,"execution_start":1700242996281,"source_hash":null},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["INFO:drake:Meshcat listening for connections at http://localhost:7001\n"]}],"source":["# Start the visualizer.

collision geometry\n","\n","In the KUKA arm example, if you toggle the `drake/proximity` checkbox in the MeshCat control panel a couple of times, you should see red boxes enveloping the KUKA arm appear and disappear. Those are the collision geometries defined in `iiwa7_with_box_collision.sdf` that are usually consumed by a motion planning or collision checking module when running the simulation.\n","\n","Even though we can use the same mesh to represent both the visual and collision geometry, approximating a complex mesh, like the KUKA arm, by primitive shapes can reduce the computation enormously. It's easier to check whether two cylinders collide than two irregular cylinder-like meshes. For that reason, we tend to load mesh files as the visual geometry but utilize various primitives as the collision geometry.\n","\n","### Define collision geometry for your model\n","\n","As collision geometry is merely an approximation for the actual shape of your model, we want the approximation to be reasonably close to reality. A rule of thumb is to completely envelop the actual shape but not inflate it too much. For example, rather than trying to cover an L-shape model with one giant box, using two boxes or cylinders can actually better represent the shape.\n","\n","It's a balancing act between the fidelity of the approximation and the computation cycles saved. When in doubt, start with a rough approximation around the actual shape and see if any undesired behavior is introduced, e.g., the robot thinks it's in a collision when it's apparently not. Identify the questionable part of the collision geometry and replace it with a more accurate approximation, and then iterate.\n","\n","### Creating an SDFormat wrapper around a mesh file\n","\n","You might have a mesh file of an object to manipulate and want to add it to a simulation. The easiest option is to pass the OBJ file to `Parser.AddModels` directly. Parsing it directly will use default assumptions for scale, mass, etc.\n","\n","In case those defaults are insufficient, you should create an SDFormat wrapper file to specify the additional properties (mass, inertia, scale, compliance, etc.) and load that file instead. You can use the [pydrake.multibody.mesh_to_model](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.multibody.mesh_to_model.html) command-line tool to generate a baseline SDFormat file that you can then further customize.\n","\n","Another interesting up-and-coming option is [obj2mjcf](https://github.com/kevinzakka/obj2mjcf/), which also does mesh reprocessing. Drake can load MuJoCo XML files, but does not yet quite support enough of the MuJoCo file format to inter-operate well with obj2mjcf. You might be able to get it working with some fiddling.\n","\n","### Use a mesh as collision geometry\n","\n","In some cases you need to have a detailed collision geometry for your simulation, e.g., in the case of dexterous manipulation for objects with an irregular shape, it might be justifiable to use a mesh as the collision geometry directly.\n","\n","When an OBJ mesh is served as the collision geometry for a basic contact model, i.e., the point contact model, Drake will internally compute the convex hull of the mesh and use that instead. If you need a non-convex collision geometry, it's suggested to decompose your mesh to various convex shapes via a convex decomposition tool. There are many similar tools available that are mostly thin wrappers on [V-HACD](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd/). Among all, [convex_decomp_to_sdf](https://github.com/gizatt/convex_decomp_to_sdf) is a wrapper that we often use for Drake.\n","\n","However, for a more complex contact model that Drake provides, such as the hydroelastic contact model, Drake can directly utilize the actual mesh for its contact force computation.
